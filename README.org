* DONE Max posts per feed

* DONE No blurbs after N posts
Now it is just one big index HTML for each tag.
That's a little heavy tags with many posts -- especially ~all~.
How about abbreviate listing after N posts?
e.g. Just Title, Date. Maybe tags. Definitely not the blurb.
That's /most/ of the benefit of split index-N.html pages, without the hassle.

* DONE Add a ~make new~ target that creates the template file for a new post.
Would be even handier than with Frog, now that the sources must be nested in YYYY/MM dirs.

* TODO Maybe stop depending on frog/{enhance-body paths}
Split out from frog to new pkgs?
Also, the pygmentize stuff for frog spanws a long-running python process, which makes frog faster, but won't help us (in fact it may hurt a little).
