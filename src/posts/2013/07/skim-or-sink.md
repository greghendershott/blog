    Title: Skim or sink

In my experience, the way to become a better programmer is
to:

- write lots of code
- skim lots of reading material, and
- defer answers until you have questions.

To learn why you should skim this post, please read it
carefully.

On the [Racket][] mailing list, [someone asked][] the best
way to learn advanced programming topics. Folks posted many
great answers. I especially liked this advice from Neil Van
Dyke:

> You've read a lot already.  I don't know how much practical programming
> experience you have, but this reminds me to make a suggestion for anyone
> reading this email who is learning programming and doing a lot of reading...
>
> If someone has access to a computer, then my suggestion at this point is
> make sure that they are spending more time practicing programming than they
> are spending on reading.
>
> By reading books and doing problem sets only, and reasoning about
> programming in their head atop that, then someone might be able to
> understand programming theory as a mathematician might.  But if they want
> intuition and insight into how to build and evolve sustainable systems in
> the real world, then I'm not aware of any substitute for practical
> experience in programming.

I wanted to +1 that, so I started to write a reply. It grew
long and I wandered a bit off topic. So I decided to make it
into a blog post instead.

What's the rule of thumb about becoming an "expert" -- it
takes "10,000 hours" of practice, with gradually escalating
difficulty?

Does learning and study count as "practice"?

Usually my most meaningful learning experience is when I
have a question, first, and feel a personal need to learn
the answer. The need might be practical and immediate. Or it
might be a sense that I ought to know more about X at this
stage.

By contrast, with formal education and book learnin' I often
get answers to questions I don't already have. As a result,
although I learn something, I usually don't learn it as
deeply. It feels like a solution in search of a problem.

Ideally I'll go back and forth, alternating periods of
hands-on experience with periods of reflection and
study. Otherwise, if I get stuck too long in either mode, I
plateau. Ten thousand hours of plateau doesn't help.

Not to contradict the above, but sometimes I've found it
beneficial to do a shallow survey above my current pay
grade. I won't understand the material very well. I just
dive in. I sort of squint, keep calm, and solider on. Some
small residue lurks in my subconscious for months or
years. Someday, when certain questions arise, something will
click --- I'll be able to recognize that it's time to return
and learn that topic for real. At which point I'm ready and
motivated to learn it.

I think this touches on a certain style of learning and
memory that is an important survival skill for
programmers. In the pre-internet days, I knew a programmer
whose daughter sometimes watched him working. She was asked
what her dad does. She explained, "He looks things up in
books."

Today the look-it-up technology has evolved. And the amount
of information to be known has grown exponentially.  But I
think the coping strategy is the same. It's making use of
the recognition half of memory (as opposed to the recall
half). It's knowing _just_ enough about a topic, to be aware
that it exists, and to recognize a situation where you
should look up the details.

That's why I recommend you skim. Surf. Browse. Whatever verb
floats your boat. Because mainly you want to
float. Something catch your eye?  Sure, dive in. But not too
long. Come back up for air, and keep moving along.

If you're fresh out of school and accustomed to careful
study, this will feel ... all _wrong_. Get over it. Adopt a
slogan from (gasp) liberal arts colleges: This is about
learning how to learn. And in the real world of programming,
this is how you learn. In my experience.

In conclusion, thank you for carefully reading this blog
post. But next time, skim it.

p.s. Mainly I'm talking about things like APIs,
specifications, and languages: All you will ever need to
know is impossible for a normal person to memorize and
recall. Of course you could argue that the basic principles
of computer science haven't changed much in 50+ years:
Pioneering explorers like [Alonzo Church][],
[Alan Turing][], [Alan Kay][][^1], [John McCarthy][], and
[Douglas Engelbart][] mined that vein deeply. The rest of
us? We smelt their ore and craft jewels. We prospect
downstream, sifting for remaining nuggets. The core ideas
are knowable, and worth more than a squinty skim.

If you were to argue that, I'd agree. Even so, I'd argue
that our understanding of those fundamentals will be deeper
and richer --- less rote --- the greater our hands-on
experience with gradually more-challenging programming.
