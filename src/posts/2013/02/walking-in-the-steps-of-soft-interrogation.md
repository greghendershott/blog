    Title: Walking in the steps of soft interrogation

For many years I visited [Frankfurt Musikmesse][]. Roughly speaking,
Musikmesse is Europe's equivalent of the [NAMM show][] in the US.

Folks from my company would stay north of Frankfurt at the
[Mövenpick Hotel][] in Oberursel. It was more affordable and very
comfortable. The front desk staff remained the same for many
years. They got to know us--the obviously American, odd musician
types--and were very friendly.

A couple years ago, I'd scheduled to fly home on Sunday, in case I
needed to have more meetings on Saturday. The meetings never
materialized, and I took it as a free day. The April weather was
unseasonably warm. I walked into Oberursel's small "downtown" and
explored it like I never had before. At some point I ended up
wandering into paths that led through parks and open fields. It was
very beautiful.

Today I read the BBC article about Obergefreiter Hanns Scharff,
[the WWII interrogator who used kindness over violence][Scharff]. In
short, he got amazing results via his "firm conviction that
interrogation could succeed without treating prisoners in an inhumane
manner." As the BBC says, this is a timely topic:

> Scharff died in California 20 years ago but his legacy remains. At
> first his name did not figure in the sharp and bitter public exchanges
> about the morality of waterboarding and so-called "enhanced
> interrogation techniques" that were sanctioned by President George
> Bush and inflicted on alleged terrorists detained in Abu Ghraib
> prison, Guantanamo Bay and secret CIA detention centre.

What did he do instead?

> He pretended to be a prisoner's best pal. Masquerading as a nice
> guy, Scharff arranged for special treats outside the confines of
> Dulag Luft. He arranged for one prisoner to enjoy a brief flight in
> a German fighter plane, prisoners were treated to slap-up feeds
> with German fliers, granted medical treatment and even permitted to
> go on an outing to the local zoo.
> 
> Typically, after extracting a precautionary undertaking that he would
> not use the opportunity to make a bid to escape, a prisoner could
> enjoy a visit to Oberursel forest, with Scharff acting as chaperone
> and guide.
>  
> Rambling along woodland paths the two men chatted about the flora and
> fauna and engaged in small talk, including for example, musing about
> British and US social activities or customs.

Wait, what? Oberursel?

It turns out I may have unknowingly been walking on the same paths as
did Scharff and his prisoners over 50 years ago.

Others should walk that path. Well, the metaphorical path: Not only is
torture unethical, it's [less effective][] than smarter interrogation
approaches.
