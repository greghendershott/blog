My [Chrome](http://www.google.com/chrome) extensions these days, from
left to right...

### Xmarks

[Xmarks](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xmarks-bookmark-sync/ajpgkpeckebdhofmmjfgcjjiiejpodla?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon)
to sync bookmarks. (But _not_ passwords; I use LastPass for that.)

### AdBlock

[AdBlock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/adblock/gighmmpiobklfepjocnamgkkbiglidom?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon) to, well, block ads.

When someone jokes about the latest bizarre ad that Facebook showed them, I'm like: Ads?

Note: I do unblock ads for specific sites I want to support.

### LastPass

[LastPass](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/lastpass/hdokiejnpimakedhajhdlcegeplioahd?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon)
to manage passwords.

If I were forced to choose just one, it would have to be
LastPass. It's the only realistic way to Do the Right Thing with
passwords. Such as creating sufficiently strong passwords. And not
reusing the same password across multiple web sites.

It's also the only sane way to use such passwords on mobile devices.

It's available for all major browsers, for free. To also use on your
mobile devices you pay a fee per month.

You can set it up to use
[two-factor authentication](http://helpdesk.lastpass.com/security-options/#Multifactor+Authentication+Options):
something you _have_ (e.g. your phone) as well as something you _know_
(the password).

### Music Plus for Google Play Music

[Music Plus for Google Play Music](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/music-plus-for-google-pla/ipfnecmlncaiipncipkgijboddcdmego?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon)
to make [Google Play Music](https://play.google.com/store/music)
spiffier and scrobble to [Last.fm](http://last.fm/).


Although I'm mostly using [Rdio](http://www.rdio.com/) these days to discover music, what I'd already purchased is stored in Google Play Music.

### Ghostery

[Ghostery](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ghostery/mlomiejdfkolichcflejclcbmpeaniij?utm_source=chrome-ntp-icon)
to block a variety of "trackers". My most-recent addition.


# tl;dr

The must-have extension is LastPass.
