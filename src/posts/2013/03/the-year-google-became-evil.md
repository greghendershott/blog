What struck me is the obvious search-and-replace:

Will we look back on 2013 as the year that Google became "Evil"? When
"do no evil" became a quaint artifact of corporate mythology?

I realize plenty of people have probably been saying Google is evil
for some time already. And some won't say it for a long time, if
ever. Just like with Microsoft.

It's weird timing. Couple days ago, on Wednesday, I sign up for my
first-ever Google I/O conference. Later that evening, Google announces
"spring cleaning", killing Google Reader and CalDAV. Thursday everyone
forgets it's Pi Day; how sad. I'm spending time looking at Google
Reader alternatives. I'm downloading Thunderbird and starting to
question my continued use of Gmail. My cherished Gmail!

Is this how it starts, step by step? Someday will we look back on this
as the inflection point?
