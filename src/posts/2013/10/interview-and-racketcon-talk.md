I haven't posted here in awhile because I've been busy with a variety
of things in September, including an interview for IEEE _Computer_
magazine and a talk about [Frog][] at RacketCon. And I'm writing this
in Japan.

## Interview

Brian Gaff interviews me on the topic, "So You Want to Start a
Software Company?". The written interview appears in the October 2013
issue of IEEE _Computer_ magazine. Although I don't have a URL to that
yet[^1], Brian and I also did a follow-up podcast you can listen to
[here][podcast].

Although I think the interview is mostly common-sense stuff, it might
be useful to someone who is starting a company.

## RacketCon

At RacketCon I gave a 10 minute talk about [Frog][]. The video is
[here][video]. This was the third RacketCon and I think by far the
best one. There was a really nice variety of talks, ranging from
practical to PL/academic and everything in between.

I also stopped by ICFP since it was held in Boston this year. Most of
the presentations were waaaay over my head. I was one of the very few
not associated with academia or corporate research. Although it
wouldn't have been worthwhile (for me) to travel for it, it was
interesting to see firsthand.

## Japan

I'm typing this blog post in Japan. Two aspects to that.

The trip to Japan is the first one I've done purely for fun, in many
years. I had to travel here three or four times a year for work, for
many years. But I couldn't take many --- or any --- free days on most
of those trips. So I thought it would be fun to return as a
"tourist". Or maybe I miss the extreme jet lag, in some variation of
Stockholm Syndrome. Someone once said, "jet lag is the best drug".
Although I'm not qualified to verify that claim empirically, there is
something surreal about a 13 hour shift. On the other hand it also has
its soul-sucking moments, as _Lost in Translation_ portrayed so well.

The other aspect is that I'm typing this SSH-ing into a VPS, using a
ChromeBook Pixel as the client. This is a bit of an experiment, which
I'll write about more if it works well.
