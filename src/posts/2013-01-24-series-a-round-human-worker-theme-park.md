I am seeking funding for a new venture: A theme park featuring "human
workers".

The theme park will be similar to
[Old Sturbridge Village](http://www.osv.org/) or
[Plimoth Plantation](http://www.plimoth.org/), but focusing on the
last half of the 20th century.

<!-- more -->

Visitors will be able to see humans performing a variety of quaint
tasks, such as:

- Cooking and cleaning
- Serving food
- Constructing buildings
- Paralegal work such as reviewing evidence
- Writing and testing software programs
- Helping humans with health issues (a so-called "doctor" or
  "physician")

Upon admission, visitors receive a small stack of paper known as
"money" or "currency". They give this to the cast members, as a way to
participate in the illusion that the activities have a financial
value. (Historically, this paper would be exchanged among humans for
various kinds of goods and services, in what was known as "the
economy".)

This theme park gives visitors a way to experience the quaint period
where most humans did work for money and were categorized as
"middle-class".

Guest services will include typical amenities such as battery-changing
stations.

Please look forward to my Series A round proposal in the coming
months. I will try to post something to <a href="https://angel.co/"
target="_blank">AngelList</a>, too.

Thank you.
