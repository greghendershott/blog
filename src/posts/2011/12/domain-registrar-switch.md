    Title: Domain registrar switch

My domain wasn't working for ~24 hours due to my switching from
GoDaddy to Namecheap. Although it's possible to make that kind of
switch with minimal downtime, in my case:

1. It was an impulse decision on my part. (Finally got some time to
   reflect on GoDaddy's support for SOPA. As well as the elephant
   killing and the tacky "babe marketing". SOPA was strike three.)

2. GoDaddy
   [seemed to be dragging their heels releasing transfers](http://community.namecheap.com/blog/2011/12/26/godaddy-transfer-update/).

3. Namecheap seemed to be struggling with an unexpected number of
   transfers, inconveniently over the holiday weekend. (In fairness to
   GoDaddy, maybe their delay was at least _partly_ due to the same
   reason.)

Fortunately it's not as if greghendershott.com is a hot destination
for millions of fans. Or dozens.

Also, I wanted to mention that I did a couple live chats with
Namecheap support and they were very helpful and quick.
