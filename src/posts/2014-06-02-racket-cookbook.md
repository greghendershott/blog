Two parallel thoughts:

1. I haven't blogged in awhile. I've been heads-down on a few projects.
Plus I haven't had ideas I feel are "big" or unique enough to merit a
post.

2. It's occurred to me that a "Racket Cookbook" might be a useful
resource. Because examples. Because real-life, practical examples.[^1]

Although I haven't created a cookbook, my working assumption is that
it would be better to write one recipe at a time. As they arise. As I
think, "Ah right, this wasn't obvious to me when I was learning
Racket."

So I plan to experiment with releasing the things one at a time, as
short blog posts. Thereby terminating two avian organisms with one
geologic projectile.

Not sure if I'll keep it up. Definitely not sure if I'll ever collect
and polish them into a "book" of some form. They might only ever live
as a `racket-cookbook` tag on this blog.

[^1]: Admittedly I rarely recall using any "cookbook" resource to find
the answer to a problem I have. Taken literally, programming cookbooks
are largely a failure, for me. On the other hand, flipping through one
can give the "flavor" of a language. And
[as I've written](/2013/07/skim-or-sink.html), one valid learning
strategy is to absorb things shallowly -- you may not know the answer,
but you know roughly where to _find_ the answer. It rings a bell.
Probably cookbooks fit that model -- filling your head with, um,
bells.
