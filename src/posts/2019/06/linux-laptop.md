For the first time, ever, I've been using Linux on raw hardware for a
couple months. The experience has been utterly boring and wonderful.

Sometime in the 1990s, I upgraded a desktop computer from something
like Windows 3.1 to Windows 95. The result was... not good. Some
hardware wasn't working well. I remember cursing Plug and Play. I
figured out some things, but that computer never was fully right.
Eventually I replaced it.

That experience left me feeling, I'd rather do any major operating
system upgrade as a result of buying a new computer.

There was a time when many Windows laptops didn't "just work" when it
came to things like power management or wireless networking.
Eventually that improved. But then Linux had a similar reputation for
many years. And I really don't want to spend time futzing with basics.

My previous dalliances with Linux include:

- Using Linux in a Virtual Box VM. Generally works, maybe slowly.

- Using [crouton] on a Chomebook Pixel. For awhile, this seemed like
  the best of both worlds, to me. Rely on Chrome OS to have decent
  drivers for power, networking, trackpad.

- Using Windows Subsystem for Linux. This is actually what led me to
  go all-in. Around New Year's, I got a Windows laptop with the idea
  that I'd test Racket Mode on Windows, that way. I got side-tracked
  by playing with WSL. Then I got frustrated by WSL support for Emacs
  getting worse not better over time.

About three months ago, I followed this [guide]: "Installing Ubuntu
18.04 LTS on a Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Carbon Gen 6".

Since then, I've hit a few "milestones" where I expected I might have my first bad experience:

- Suspend/resume? It worked.

- Connecting an external 4K monitor via a USB-C cable? Both displays
  working fine. Laptop getting charged.

- Printing? It found the driver for the printer and printed. Yawn.

Maybe it's beginner's luck. Maybe I'm in the honeymoon phase. I keep
waiting for the other shoe to drop.
