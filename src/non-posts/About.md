# About me

My interest in music led me to an interest in computer programming,
which led me to an interest in business.

I started the music software company Cakewalk in 1987 as a bootstrap.
I grew it out of cash flow until 2003, when Roland Corporation became
an investor. As I approached the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary in 2012,
I sold my remaining stake. I wanted to explore new things.

I spent a few years enjoying hands-on programming again, particularly
open source projects using [Racket].

I did a batch at Hacker School (now called [Recurse Center]) where I
worked on projects using Clojure, Haskell, and Python.

I worked at Droit Financial Technologies where I used Clojure and
Datomic.

Most recently I founded Extramaze LLC, where I'm building things using
Racket, including a [search engine for deals on music gear][deals].
Also I am available as a consultant.
