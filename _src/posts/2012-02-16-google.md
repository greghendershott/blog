In case you hadn't noticed, I'm not exactly posting here, much.

This is not a firehose of information.

This is not a bountiful font of wisdom from which you can aspire
merely to glean a glimmering glimpse of insight.

This is not a haystack containing needles such as the secrets to
wealth, popularity, and whiter teeth.

This blog will not cause Comcast to send you a warning that you are
about to exceed your 250 GB of unlimited data.


Why?  Simply because (a) I don't have that much to say, and (b) what I
do have to say, I'm saying on Google+.  That is my de facto "blog",
for now.

See you [there](https://plus.google.com/u/0/107023078912536369392/posts).
