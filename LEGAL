I am showing work-in-progress.

As a result, this repo currently includes a mix of material, ranging
from blog post prose to programming source code.

1. A few programming source files -- for example Makefile and rkt/*rkt
   -- include an Apache 2.0 license statement in the file.

2. All remaining files -- including but not limited to src/* -- are
   provided with NO LICENSE. Every such file is:

     Copyright (c) 2011-2019 by Greg Hendershott. All rights reserved.

In short: Unless a file contains an explicit Apache 2.0 license
statement, no license or rights are granted.
